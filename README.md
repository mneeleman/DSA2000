# DSA2000
DSA2000 simulation code

**mockcat.py:** Some initial code based on the simulations by
D. Obreschkow. This code will generate the "wedge plot", "sky
distribution plot" as well as any other figures that are based on the
information within the simulation.

**tng_sims.py:** Some very preliminary code that will take the TNG50
simulations and convert them into HI cubes.

**cosmichimass.py:** Code to create the rhoHI plot (or OmegaHI). It
will take the literature values collected in Neeleman et al. (2016)
--with some updates.
